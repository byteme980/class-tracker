# ClassTracker

## Inspiration
ClassPass lets you go to each studio a maximum of 3 times per month, but they don't give you an easy way to keep track of how many times you've been to each studio, so I've built a Chrome Extension to do just that.

## How to Use
Download this repo. Navigate to  [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and make sure Developer mode is toggled on. Click "Load Unpacked extension" and select this repo with the file picker.

When you're logged in to ClassPass in the past classes section, the extension parses the list of classes you've been to and appends details on the studio visits and frequency of visits per studio for the current monthly cycle.
